# E-Commerce Backend

This is a backend application for an e-commerce website.

## First

In order to run the application be sure to run npm install to install the necessary packages. Once installed you will want to create your own .env file with your own MySQL login credentials. 

Once you are up and running be sure to navigate to your own MySQL server with mysql -u root -p, once your password is inserted be sure to source the schema.sql file and use the newly created database. Exit the server and then run the application using npm start.
